## Architecture Diagram
For a visual representation of the system architecture, refer to the AWS architecture diagram that should be created showing:
- Frontend S3 bucket with CloudFront
- Backend ECS containers
- MongoDB Atlas connection
- S3 storage buckets
- OpenAI integration
- User flow through the system

This diagram should be included in the project documentation once created.
